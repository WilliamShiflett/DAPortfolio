# DAPortfolio

Welcome.

I've created this repository to showcase the work I've done to date as a data analyst.

You'll find scripts that I've written in SAS, R, and Python. The focus is generally on obtaining, cleaning, updating, and analyzing data. 

Some scripts come from academic assignments, others come from my own exploration of different data sets, and still others are created to demonstrate working knowledge of specific functions a data analyst might be expected to fulfill.
