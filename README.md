# DAPortfolio

Welcome.

I've created this repository to highlight my experience using SAS, Python and R for data analysis.

Some of these projects are based on work I've done as a data anaylst or as a student of statistics, while others are based on tutorials. 

When posting a script deriving from a tutorial, I've included a note saying as much. Where possible, I've also tried to apply the tutorial's lesson to data not included in the tutorial. My intention in doing so is to demonstrate mastery of the tutorial's techniques.
