# DAPortfolio

Welcome.

I've created this repository to showcase work I've done as a data analyst. 

You'll find scripts in SAS, R, and Python. Within some of these scripts, you'll find some queries for use with the respective software's SQL interpreter.

Most of the scripts are related to obtaining, cleaning, updating, and analyzing data, all of which comes from public sources. Others are contrived to demonstrate a particular technique.
