# Data Analyst Portfolio

Welcome.

I've created this repository to highlight my experience using SAS, Python and R for data analysis.

Some of these projects are based on work I've done as a data analyst, while others are based on tutorials or textbook examples. 

When posting a script based on a tutorial, I've included a note about it.
