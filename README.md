# Data Analyst Portfolio

Welcome.

I've created this repository to highlight my experience using SAS, Python and R for data analysis.

Some of these projects are based on work I've done as a data analyst or as a student of Statistics, while others are based on tutorials, textbook examples, etc. 

When posting a script deriving from a tutorial, I've included a note saying as much. Where possible, I've also tried to apply the tutorial's techniques to data not included in the tutorial.
